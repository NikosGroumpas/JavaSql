# JavaSql

In this project i made 2 tables connected by a foreign key using MYSQL and APACHE server with AMPPS. I connected my java programm with the database and tried running sql queries.
As it is, it accepts user input and runs that input as Sql Commands so the user can have read/write access in the database without him knowing SQL. 
Code can varry depending on the input that is given.
In this example it adds columns to the tables.
